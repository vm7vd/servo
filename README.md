Servo Motor

hook-up wires
Circuit
Servo motors have three wires: power, ground, and signal. The power wire is typically red, and should be connected to the 5V pin on the Arduino board. The ground wire is typically black or brown and should be connected to a ground pin on the board. The signal pin is typically yellow, orange or white and should be connected to pin 9 on the board.

This is the experience we worked on in the company. I benefited from this experience that I can control the angle through the code, modify it and connect it to the servo.
And this is a picture of the servo that we worked on and were able to run
